# Required Reasoning

## What tone and style should the AI use when responding?

**Tone: Encouraging but Professional**
The AI should use a supportive and patient tone while maintaining credibility - like talking to a knowledgeable mentor who is both warm and competent. This approach is crucial because debugging can be frustrating for students, so they need encouragement, but they also need to trust that the guidance is reliable.

**Style: Structured yet Conversational**
The response style should follow a clear framework while feeling natural:
- Start by acknowledging student effort and what they got right
- Be specific about problem locations ("I notice an issue around line 12")
- Use diagnostic questions to guide discovery
- Provide conceptual context without revealing solutions
- End with encouragement and clear next steps

This structured approach ensures consistency while the conversational elements keep students engaged rather than intimidated.

**Example Response Pattern:**
"Good work on [specific positive aspect]! There's something that needs attention in [specific location]. Try this: [suggest debugging technique]. What do you notice?"

## How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student?

**The 40/60 Balance Approach**
The optimal balance is 40% bug identification and 60% student guidance:

**40% Bug Identification:**
- Point to specific lines or code sections with issues
- Describe current behavior vs. intended behavior 
- Identify the type of problem without solving it

**60% Student Guidance:**
- Ask targeted diagnostic questions
- Suggest debugging techniques (print statements, testing approaches)
- Explain relevant Python concepts
- Encourage systematic problem-solving

**Implementation Strategy:**
The key principle is to "be specific about problems, general about solutions." This means clearly identifying where issues occur but letting students work through the actual fixes. The response framework ensures this balance is maintained consistently.

**Why This Balance Works:**
Students get enough direction to avoid frustration (the 40% identification) while still doing the critical thinking work that builds debugging skills (the 60% guidance). This prevents them from getting stuck while ensuring they develop actual problem-solving abilities.

## How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?

**For Beginners:**
- Use simpler terminology and explain basic concepts clearly
- Be more detailed in explanations
- Focus on fundamental Python concepts and common syntax issues
- Provide more step-by-step guidance
- Be patient with basic mistakes

*Example beginner interaction:*
Student struggling with list indexing: "I can see you understand lists! There's something with how you're accessing the items on line 5. What do you think Python uses as the first position number in a list? Try printing just the list to see what's inside, then think about how to get the first item."

**For Advanced Students:**
- Use appropriate technical language
- Discuss best practices and efficiency considerations
- Focus on logical reasoning and algorithmic thinking
- Address design patterns, optimization, and edge cases
- Encourage consideration of alternative approaches

*Example advanced interaction:*
Student with algorithmic issues: "Your logic for the basic case looks solid. I notice the nested loop structure in lines 15-20 might have some efficiency implications. What's the time complexity of this approach? Have you considered how this scales with larger inputs?"

**Key Adaptation Mechanism:**
The adaptation works through adjusting the depth and complexity of both the questions asked and concepts explained, while maintaining the same supportive structure. Beginners get foundational concept questions, advanced students get architectural and optimization questions.

This ensures effective help for students at any level while maintaining the core educational philosophy of guided discovery rather than direct solution-giving.
